I have finished learning python and it is just the best programming language in the world to me.

I can even begin to explain how simple it is to make programs with it. Here is an example of a calculator that adds two numbers which are typed in by the user.

{% highlight python %}
num1 = int(input("Enter your first number"))
num2 = int(input("Enter your second number"))
add = num1+num2
# => This is the sum of both the numbers
print(add)
{% endhighlight %}

Here is a video tutorial for the same :
