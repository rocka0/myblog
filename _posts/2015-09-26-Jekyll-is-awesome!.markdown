I have been using jekyll for a while now and it is Boss!

The static site generator has blown me away. This doesn't happen to often.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Here is a quick tutorial that helps you make a jekyll website after you have installed it. To install it, type :

{% highlight ruby%}
gem install jekyll
{% endhighlight %}
