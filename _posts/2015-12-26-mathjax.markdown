In this post, I'm gonna talk about mathjax!

So what is mathjax? Mathjax allows you to do this:  $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

Basically, it allows you to render math equations. I think its pretty cool. Help in math posts!

So lets get started!

First, include a script tag in your html page which allows you to use mathjax:

{% highlight html %}
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

Just copy the script tag from above

Now, all you have to do to render mathjax equations is to put the equation between $ signs.

Here's an example:

$$ {\left(\frac{\sqrt x}{y^3}\right)} $$

Have fun with your equations!

$$ :wq $$
