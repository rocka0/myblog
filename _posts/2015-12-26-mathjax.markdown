In this post, I'm gonna talk about mathjax!

So what is mathjax? Mathjax allows you to do this:  $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

Basically, it allows you to render math equations. I think its pretty cool. Help in math posts!

So lets get started!

First, include a script tag in your html page which allows you to use mathjax:

{% highlight html %}
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

Just copy the script tag from above and put it in your html page

Now, all you have to do to render mathjax equations is to put the equation between $ signs.

For example:

If you wanted to write the equation x = -b + or - root b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac by 2a (the quadractic formula), you would put the following lines in between the dollar signs:

x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}

The \frac makes the first {} and second {} a fraction and the \sqrt makes the term inside the {} a root.

Thus, the final equation looks like this:

$$ 
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} $$

Have fun with your equations!

$$ :wq $$
