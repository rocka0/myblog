  How Hasura decided to not only give me an internship but also make a post about me
---

Welcome to my first blog post!
===================
------

Funnily, in my first blog post I will be talking about how [I](http://rocka0.github.io) was featured by [this](https://hasura.io/) company:

![enter image description here](http://res.cloudinary.com/hrscywv4p/image/upload/c_limit,fl_lossy,h_1440,w_720,f_auto,q_auto/v1/138836/Hasura_Image_refw4t.png)

in their [blog post about me.](https://blog.hasura.io/how-building-an-app-is-different-from-taking-programming-courses-a-15-yr-olds-story-c7725c59ccb4?gi=be4939fde7ea) 

Also you shall find how I landed a spot in the [internship](https://hasura.io/education?utm_source=Medium&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=imad%20stories&utm_content=Tushar#hpdf) given by [Hasura](http://hasura.io).

----------


**How it Started**
-------------

I happened to come across a course on modern application development: https://www.imad.tech.  

This course was given by the company I mentioned earlier: [Hasura](http://hasura.io) , in partnership with IIT Madras.

It was an 8 weeks course and hell it was the best time of my life. There were around **127,000** students who took the course and I was fortunate to land in the top 4% or **550**  students who landed a spot in the **[internship](https://hasura.io/education?utm_source=Medium&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=imad%20stories&utm_content=Tushar#hpdf)**  given by Hasura.

**Internship**
------

So the official Hasura Product Development Fellowship or just **Internship** for short started in the **first** week of December. 

We were assigned to work on **the front-end or back-end**. I was lucky enough to get my preference: Front-end. 

Throughout the course of the internship we are supposed to build an app based on the idea alloted to us and we would be graded based on that.

In my next blog post,  I shall talk about the tasks in the first week of the internship.

**Being Featured**
-----------

What I am super duper hyped about is that Hasura decided to take it one step further and give me a spot in their company's **official blog**.

I had received a call from one of their team members asking me if I wanted to be featured.

All I could say was: **Hell yeah!**

So I sent them some information about myself and what I wanted to do and become and guess what? They made the most **beautiful and descriptive** blog post about me:
