<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hi, my name is Tush Chen. I'm a programmer with a passion for web programming. I am an 10th grade student and an aspiring coder, gamer and ethical hacker! I want to be able to code fluently in all programming languages!</p>

<h2>How did I get into programming?</h2>

<p>It all started in 6th grade. I told my dad I was bored and that I wanted to play Club Penguin. He told me that it was better to make a game and play it than just play it. Since then, Iâ€™ve been making apps and game for all platforms and now I feel programming is a part of my life and I cant live without it.</p>
