<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hey there, my name is Tushar Chenan. I'm a programmer with a passion for web programming and artificial intelligence. I am a 12th grade student at NPS HSR and an aspiring coder, gamer and ethical hacker! I want to be able to code fluently in all programming languages! My latest achievement was that my team and I emerged right at the <strong>top</strong> as the <strong><a href="https://codewarscentral.smugmug.com/CodeWars-2019-Bangalore/i-S42hpWz/A">Overall Winners</a></strong> of HP Codewars Bangalore 2019! </p>

<h2>How did I get into programming?</h2>

<p>It all started in 6th grade. I told my dad I was bored and that I wanted to play Club Penguin. He told me that it was better to make a game and play it than just play it. Since then, Iâ€™ve been making apps and game for all platforms and now I feel programming is a part of my life and I just can't live without it.</p>
